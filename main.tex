\maketitle

This case study investigates the ethical conduct and social responsibility of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA).

%1.	Provide a brief overview of the major shareholders of Commonwealth Bank from the 2019 annual report and a brief overview of the Board of Directors. 
\section{Major Shareholders of CBA and Overview of Board of Directors}
The top twenty shareholders in hold 49.72\% of the total issued CBA shares \cite{cba19}. Six of the largest holding shareholders are described below in Table~\ref{tab:shareholders}, along with their respective industries. Under CBA’s Constitution, each ordinary shareholder who is present at the general meeting holds one vote for each share held \cite{cba19}. Therefore, shares held is representative of the voting power of that shareholder.

%3.	What influence do you think the major shareholders will have on the Board? (150 worcs, 10%)
%Accurately identifies the shareholders and Directors, and provides considerable detail of them and provides an excellent analysis of their involvement in the firm.
The majority of these large shareholders are in the banking, commercial services and financial services industries. They influence the board by deciding who become board members, through a vote. CBA’s larger shareholders may prefer board members who are trusted by those in the aforementioned industries. Shareholders participating in the same industry may also have aligned interests, opinions about directors and therefore voting behaviour.
\\

%2.	Are any Directors involved in other companies? 
There are 10 members in the Board of Directors in the various committees for risk, audit, nominations, and people and renumeration. Two directors are executive, the remaining non-executive directors. Most interestingly, Shirish Apte, an Independent Non-Executive Director, previously worked in executive roles for Citi Asia \cite{cba19}. It may be purely coincidental that Citicorp Nominees Pty Ltd owns 6.04\% of the company.


\section{Breaches of Code of Conduct and Ethics}

How would Commonwealth Bank's Code of Conduct and Ethics be improved in relation to IT Governance? How could increasing the level of IT Governance to Commonwealth Bank's Code of Conduct and Ethics add value (both tangible and intangible) and reduce risk (in terms of operation risk and systematic risk) to the bank? Briefly explain your reasoning and include illustrative examples to reinforce your point of view. (200 words, 25%)
